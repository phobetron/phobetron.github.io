# Github Pages Boilerplate

Including Jekyll, Webpack, Babel, and Vue.

## Development
To run:
```
> npm run dev
```
Dev mode currently uses `webpack --watch` and `jekyll serve`, so while files are
processed when modified, the browser still needs a refresh.

## Production
To build:
```
> npm run build
```
